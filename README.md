# Flutter Assignment

I have attempted to make the a Fluter web App close to the UI provided. But i have implemented the features accuratly that i feel to be added in the UI 

## Getting Started

The app is responsive in mobile as well as desktop browser. 

The approach is the UI was to first make a NavBar and a section to show the data of the orders of the user. At a single time only 4 orders are shown and rest can be seen with the next and previous button. 

Ascending and descending sorting is available on the Time, Client, QTY and Price columns.

you could even add the filters by searching the client_id and stock, fute , options name from the search bar.

I have used a dummy data to fill the table of the orders and implemented the necessary features.
